# Front-end Challenge: OMDb Movie Nomination üçø

Deployed App: https://shopify-application.vercel.app

The front-end challenge was to create a webpage to help users search OMDB movies and select/nominate 5 of their favorite movies. The data were pulled from the OMDb public API. On top of the basic requirements (search, add/remove from nominatin list, display banner after 5 nominations, etc), some extras I added includes crafting my own design, adding notifications for when the user tries to select more than 5, and a details section to show the poster image of the selected movie.

Stack:
- Next.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind css
